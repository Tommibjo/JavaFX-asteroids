# JavaFX-asteroids
School project:
"No you know how to work with bigger projects". 
Every method & class <i>(I can't remember if we already used java classes to form objects here)</i> naming was quite copy paste stuff.

Classic asteroids game. Project is in finnish language.

* Created with Netbeans Platform 8.2
* Simple Apache ant (1.9.7) JavaFX (8.0) project
